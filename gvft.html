      <p>
        Gestalt Vector Field Theory (GVFT) introduces a meta-architectural framework for specifying and evolving modular neural network topologies using continuous multi-field representations defined over a spatial domain. Instead of encoding fixed graphs, GVFT defines smooth, differentiable fields—such as connectivity flows, synaptic strengths, conduction delays, cell-type preferences, and neuromodulatory gradients—that serve as generative blueprints from which full architectures emerge. These fields, inspired by biological development and dynamical systems, encode both structural and functional priors in a compact and evolvable form. We describe practical techniques for deriving modular networks from these fields, introduce variational optimization and constraint-based regularization, and model time-evolving influences through reaction-diffusion equations. GVFT offers a principled bridge between continuous field dynamics and discrete architectural instantiation, enabling new pathways for interpretable and adaptive cognitive systems.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Neural networks are typically engineered as fixed graphs—collections of layers or modules connected in predefined ways. Even advanced techniques like Neural Architecture Search (NAS), hypernetworks, or Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs) operate within discrete design spaces. These systems often lack the flexibility, compositionality, and developmental dynamics seen in biological cognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human cognition is modular by nature. Perception, language, memory, and planning arise from specialized systems that interact across space and time. These interactions are not hand-coded; they develop within spatially constrained substrates shaped by gradients, delays, and modulatory chemistry. Yet contemporary machine learning rarely treats <em>inter-module interaction</em> as a first-class design target.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gestalt Vector Field Theory (GVFT)</strong> introduces a continuous, field-based framework for specifying how modules in a cognitive system interact. Instead of directly building network graphs, GVFT defines spatial fields that encode architectural influences—such as directional connectivity, synaptic weight potentials, and neuromodulatory flows. These fields serve as a generative substrate from which network topology emerges, subject to local field values and global consistency constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "gestalt" is used here to emphasize that cognitive structure arises from the interaction of multiple overlapping influences, not from any single fixed specification. GVFT encodes these influences as smooth, differentiable fields that are jointly optimized, interpreted, and sampled to produce functional modular networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        This framework offers a new kind of design space: spatial, differentiable, and biologically grounded. Rather than asking "what architecture performs best," GVFT invites the question: "what field dynamics give rise to compositional cognition?" It provides both the mathematical tools and the conceptual vocabulary to explore that space.
      </p>
    </section>    

    <section>
      <h2>1. Conceptual Model</h2>
      <p>
        Gestalt Vector Field Theory (GVFT) defines a modular neural architecture not as a fixed graph, but as a collection of continuous fields over a spatial domain. Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a continuous region—such as a 2D plane or abstract cognitive substrate—on which these fields are defined. Each field encodes a biologically or functionally meaningful quantity at every point $\mathbf{x} \in \Omega$. We denote the field ensemble as:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\Theta(\mathbf{x}, t) = \{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}, t), \ldots, \phi_n(\mathbf{x}, t)\}$$
      </div>
      <p>
        In this work, we focus on three core GVFT fields that capture essential dynamics of modular network formation, with the potential to incorporate additional fields to model more complex interactions as needed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Connectivity Flow</strong> ($\phi_1 = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t) \in \mathbb{R}^d$): A time-evolving vector field defining preferred directions of information flow, analogous to axon guidance gradients in biological development.</li>
        <li><strong>Synaptic Strength</strong> ($\phi_2 = W(\mathbf{x}, t) \in \mathbb{R}$): A time-evolving scalar field encoding potential connection strength at each point, influencing the likelihood and weight of inter-module connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuromodulatory Field</strong> ($\phi_3 = \eta(\mathbf{x}, t) \in \mathbb{R}$): A time-evolving scalar field representing diffuse modulatory signals, such as dopamine or serotonin, that affect plasticity and network dynamics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each field $\phi_k$ is represented by structured function classes suited to its role. For spatially stationary components, we may use kernel expansions (e.g., radial basis functions or Gaussian Processes):
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\phi_k(\mathbf{x}, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_k} w_{k,i}(t) \cdot k_{\theta_k}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_i)$$
      </div>
      <p>
        For fields with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, we leverage transformations in the frequency domain, where $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ denote the forward and inverse spatial Fourier transforms, respectively:
      </p>      
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\phi_k(\mathbf{x}, t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left( \sum_{|\omega| < K} R_\omega(\mathcal{F}(\phi_k)(\omega, t)) \right)$$
      </div>
    
      <h3>1.1 Interpreting the Fields</h3>
      <p>
        The GVFT fields have both biological and computational interpretations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flow Field</strong>: Guides the formation of connections, promoting structured wiring patterns akin to neural migration or axon guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>Synaptic Strength Field</strong>: Determines the potential strength of connections, modulated by local flow intensity and neuromodulatory signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuromodulatory Field</strong>: Influences plasticity, attention, or learning rates, acting as a global or local modulator of network behavior.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1.2 Field Interactions</h3>
      <p>
        The fields interact through soft coupling terms that enforce consistency and biologically inspired correlations. For example, synaptic strength depends partially on the local flow magnitude:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$W(\mathbf{x}, t) = \beta_W \cdot \sigma(\|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t)\|) + (1 - \beta_W) \cdot W_{\text{base}}(\mathbf{x}, t)$$
      </div>
      <p>
        where $\sigma$ is a sigmoid function and $\beta_W \in [0, 1]$ controls coupling strength. These interactions, implemented as differentiable operations, capture structured dependencies observed in biological development, enabling the emergence of modular architectures. Additional fields could extend these interactions to model more nuanced dynamics, such as specialized neuron types or temporal delays, as future work requires.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>2. Mathematical Foundations</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Field Ensemble and Regularization</h3>
      <p>
        We define a family of $n$ fields $\Theta = \{\phi_k\}_{k=1}^n$, where each $\phi_k: \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^{m_k}$ is a continuous function over a Euclidean domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and time $t$. In this work, we focus on three fields: connectivity flow ($\mathbf{F}$), synaptic strength ($W$), and neuromodulation ($\eta$). To ensure smoothness and biological plausibility, we apply a regularization loss for each field:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k \int_{\Omega} \|\nabla \phi_k(\mathbf{x}, t)\|^2 \, d\mathbf{x}$$
      </div>
      <p>
        where $\nabla$ is the gradient operator in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $\lambda_k > 0$ are weighting coefficients, and the integral promotes spatial smoothness. For the connectivity flow field $\mathbf{F}$, we add a divergence penalty to encourage conservation and prevent implausible divergence artifacts:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{div}} = \lambda_{\text{div}} \int_{\Omega} \|\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t)\|^2 \, d\mathbf{x}$$
      </div>
      <p>
        To model interactions between fields (e.g., synaptic strength influenced by connectivity flow), we use a cross-field consistency loss:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{cross}} = \sum_{k \neq l} \lambda_{k,l} \int_{\Omega} \|\phi_k(\mathbf{x}, t) - g_{k,l}(\phi_l(\mathbf{x}, t))\|^2 \, d\mathbf{x}$$
      </div>
      <p>
        where $g_{k,l}: \mathbb{R}^{m_l} \to \mathbb{R}^{m_k}$ are learned functions (e.g., MLPs) modeling biological or functional relationships, and $\lambda_{k,l} \geq 0$ control coupling strength.
      </p>
      <h3>2.2 Field Encoding and Compression</h3>
      <p>
        To handle high-dimensional inputs (e.g., biological priors), we compress source fields $\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{x}, t) = \{f_1(\mathbf{x}, t), \ldots, f_m(\mathbf{x}, t)\}$ into the GVFT fields $\Theta(\mathbf{x}, t)$ using a mapping $\Phi: \mathcal{B}(\mathbf{x}, t) \to \Theta(\mathbf{x}, t)$, implemented as a neural network with an encoder-decoder structure:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\Theta(\mathbf{x}, t) = \Phi(\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{x}, t)) = \mathcal{D}_\theta(\mathcal{E}_\phi(\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{x}, t)))$$
      </div>
      <p>
        Here, $\mathcal{E}_\phi$ is a convolutional encoder preserving spatial locality, and $\mathcal{D}_\theta$ is a decoder producing the $n$ fields. The compression is trained to minimize:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{encode}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} + \lambda_{\text{func}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{func}}$$
      </div>
      <p>
        The reconstruction loss ensures fidelity to the input:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim \Omega} \left[ \|\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{x}, t) - \Psi(\Phi(\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{x}, t)))\|_2^2 \right]$$
      </div>
      <p>
        The functional loss preserves task-relevant features:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{func}} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim \Omega} \left[ \|Q(\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{x}, t)) - Q(\Psi(\Phi(\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{x}, t))))\|_2^2 \right]$$
      </div>
      <p>
        where $Q$ extracts features like modularity or connectivity strength, implemented as a lightweight neural network or analytical function.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>2.3 Coupled Field Dynamics and Time Evolution</h3>
      
        <p>
          GVFT simulates a system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) over a spatial domain. These equations govern the evolution of three architectural fields: the <em>connectivity flow field</em> $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t)$, the <em>synaptic strength field</em> $W(\mathbf{x}, t)$, and the <em>neuromodulatory field</em> $\eta(\mathbf{x}, t)$. These fields form a dynamical feedback loop, interacting to produce emergent network structures.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The synaptic strength field evolves under the influence of local flow magnitude, external sources, and neuromodulatory effects:
        </p>
        <div class="equation-box">
          $$\partial_t W(\mathbf{x}, t) = D_W \nabla^2 W - \lambda_W W + \beta_W \cdot \sigma(\|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t)\|) + S_W(\mathbf{x}) + \eta(\mathbf{x}, t)$$
        </div>
      
        <p>
          The flow field is modulated by local synaptic strength:
        </p>
        <div class="equation-box">
          $$\partial_t \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t) = D_F \nabla^2 \mathbf{F} - \lambda_F \mathbf{F} + \gamma_F \cdot \mathbf{F} \cdot (W(\mathbf{x}, t) - 0.5)$$
        </div>
      
        <p>
          The neuromodulatory field evolves in response to localized architectural “activity,” defined as a mixture of flow magnitude and synaptic strength:
        </p>
        <div class="equation-box">
          $$S_\eta(\mathbf{x}, t) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t)\|^2 + W(\mathbf{x}, t)^2 \right)$$
          $$\partial_t \eta(\mathbf{x}, t) = D_\eta \nabla^2 \eta - \lambda_\eta \eta + S_\eta(\mathbf{x}, t)$$
        </div>
      
        <p>
          This closed-loop coupling enables local hotspots of activity to reinforce themselves via neuromodulatory amplification, generating rich spatiotemporal patterns. The system is solved using explicit finite difference updates on a 2D grid, with all terms designed to remain differentiable for backpropagation through the field dynamics.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>3. From Fields to Graphs: Module Instantiation and Connectivity Inference</h2>
        <p>
          To generate discrete neural architectures from continuous fields, we instantiate modules by sampling their positions probabilistically based on the connectivity flow $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and synaptic strength $W(\mathbf{x}, t)$ fields, then infer connectivity weights between them. The probability of placing a module at position $\mathbf{x}$ is defined as:
        </p>
        <div class="equation-box">
          $$p(\text{module at } \mathbf{x}) = \sigma(\beta \cdot \|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t)\| + \gamma \cdot W(\mathbf{x}, t))$$
        </div>
        <p>
          where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\beta, \gamma > 0$ are parameters balancing the influence of flow magnitude and synaptic strength. We sample $N$ module centers $\{\mathbf{r}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ from this distribution using rejection sampling or a grid-based approach, with $N$ set by a hyperparameter or task requirements. Note that the simulations presented in Section 4 implement this probabilistic sampling dynamically, allowing module positions $\mathbf{r}_i(t)$ to evolve over time based on the changing fields.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3.1 Connectivity Inference</h3>
        <p>
          Inter-module connectivity weights $w_{ij}$ are computed to align with the local flow field and synaptic strength at module positions. The weight between modules at positions $\mathbf{r}_i$ and $\mathbf{r}_j$ is determined by:
        </p>
        <div class="equation-box">
          $$w_{ij} = \min\left(\max\left(\frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_j)}{\lambda}, 0\right), w_{\max}\right)$$
        </div>
        <p>
          where:
        </p>
        <div class="equation-box">
          $$\rho(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_j) = \max\left(0, \frac{(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \cdot \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}_i, t)}{\|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i\| \cdot \|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}_i, t)\|}\right) \cdot W(\mathbf{r}_i, t)$$
        </div>
        <p>
          Here, $\rho(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_j)$ measures the cosine similarity between the flow field $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}_i, t)$ and the direction from $\mathbf{r}_i$ to $\mathbf{r}_j$, scaled by the synaptic strength $W(\mathbf{r}_i, t)$. The parameter $\lambda > 0$ regularizes the weights, ensuring sensitivity to field alignment, and $w_{\max}$ caps the maximum weight. To promote sparsity, only the top-$k$ connections per module, ranked by $\rho$, are retained, reflecting biologically inspired constraints on connectivity.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Robustness of Instantiation and Inference</h3>
        <p>
          The instantiation and connectivity inference processes bridge continuous fields to discrete architectures, and their robustness depends on key parameters:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flow-Strength Balance ($\beta/\gamma$)</strong>: These parameters control the relative influence of $\mathbf{F}$ and $W$ in module placement. Theoretical analysis suggests stability across a range of ratios ($0.5 \leq \beta/\gamma \leq 2.0$), with degradation at extreme values, as the process prioritizes regions where both fields are strong. Empirical validation awaits implementation of probabilistic sampling.</li>
          <li><strong>Regularization Strength ($\lambda$)</strong>: This parameter governs how strictly connections follow the flow field direction. Lower values ($\lambda < 0.5$) produce denser networks with reduced modularity, while higher values ($\lambda > 2.0$) yield sparse, directional connectivity. Preliminary tests in our simulation suggest an intermediate range ($0.8 \leq \lambda \leq 1.5$) balances structural rigidity and functional flexibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The neuromodulatory field $\eta(\mathbf{x}, t)$ indirectly influences connectivity by modulating $W(\mathbf{x}, t)$ during field dynamics (see Section 2.3), but it does not directly affect module placement or weight computation in the current framework. Future extensions could incorporate $\eta$ or additional fields to refine placement or connectivity, such as by modulating sparsity or introducing dynamic interaction patterns.

        <h2>4. Simulation Study of Core Dynamics</h2>
          <p>
            To investigate the behavior of the coupled field dynamics proposed in Section 2.3, we performed numerical simulations to analyze how different parameter combinations affect the emergence of structured patterns across the three field types. This section details the implementation, parameter exploration, and key observations from our initial simulation studies.
          </p>
          
          <h3>4.1 Simulation Implementation Details</h3>
          <p>
            The simulations were conducted on a 200×200 grid representing the spatial domain $\Omega = [-1, 1]^2$. We employed the second-order accurate Crank-Nicolson method for time integration, using finite differences for spatial derivatives. This implicit method enhances numerical stability compared to explicit Euler schemes. The spatial Laplacian $\nabla^2$ was approximated using a standard 5-point stencil, with no-flux boundary conditions implemented through the structure of the discretized operator.
          </p>
          <p>
            For efficient computation, we implemented the following update scheme for each field:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Synaptic strength field update:</strong> $\partial_t W = D_W \nabla^2 W - \lambda_W W + \alpha \|\mathbf{F}\| + \eta_{coeff} \eta + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_W^2)$</li>
            <li><strong>Connectivity flow field update:</strong> $\partial_t \mathbf{F} = D_F \nabla^2 \mathbf{F} - \lambda_F \mathbf{F} + \beta_{coupling} \nabla W + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_F^2)$</li>
            <li><strong>Neuromodulatory field update:</strong> $\partial_t \eta = D_\eta \nabla^2 \eta - \lambda_\eta \eta + S_\eta$, where $S_\eta = \frac{1}{2} ( \|\mathbf{F}\|^2 + W^2 )$</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Module positions were dynamically resampled at each timestep based on the probability distribution defined in Section 3, with connectivity weights computed according to cosine similarity between flow field direction and inter-module vectors, scaled by local synaptic strength.
          </p>
          
          <h3>4.2 Parameter Space Exploration with Uniform Priors</h3>
          <p>
            Our initial investigations employed uniform (flat) prior distributions for all fields, initialized with minimal structure. We conducted a systematic parameter sweep across two key dimensions: the synaptic strength decay rate ($\lambda_W$) and flow field diffusion coefficient ($D_F$), while maintaining constant values for other parameters ($\lambda_\eta = 0.10$, $\eta_{coeff} = 0.050$).
          </p>
          <p>
            The resulting phase diagram reveals a clear gradient in pattern formation behavior across the parameter space. At low values of $D_F$, minimal hotspot activity is observed regardless of the $\lambda_W$ value, indicating either rapid decay or insufficient structure formation. As $D_F$ increases, we observe a monotonic increase in the fraction of grid points where $W$ exceeds the threshold value of 1.5 ("hotspot fraction"). This relationship holds across the entire range of $\lambda_W$ values tested, suggesting that flow field diffusion plays a dominant role in pattern formation under these conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            While these parameter sweeps revealed clear transitions in pattern density, the emergent structures with uniform priors exhibited limited complexity. The patterns showed regular hotspot formation but lacked the rich spatial organization and functional modularity we would expect in biologically relevant systems. This observation motivated our subsequent work toward incorporating non-uniform, biologically informed priors.
          </p>
          
          <h3>4.3 Limitations of Uniform Prior Simulations</h3>
          <p>
            Detailed examination of the full simulation runs revealed several limitations of the uniform prior approach:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Limited Pattern Diversity:</strong> The emergent patterns tended toward simple geometric arrangements rather than the complex, hierarchical structures observed in biological neural systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak Field Coupling:</strong> The coupling between fields, while mathematically sufficient to drive pattern formation, failed to produce strong functional dependencies that would support modular information processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Absence of Functional Motifs:</strong> The resulting architectures lacked recognizable computational motifs such as feedforward chains, recurrent circuits, or center-surround organizations common in biological neural systems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These observations highlight the importance of informed prior distributions in guiding the emergence of functionally relevant architectural patterns. While the flat prior simulations provided valuable insights into the basic dynamics of the GVFT system, they underscored the need for biologically grounded initialization to achieve patterns with greater functional relevance.

      <h2>5. Optimizing Field Parameters via Task-Driven Gradients</h2>
      <p>
        We optimize the field parameters $\theta$ (e.g., neural network weights defining $\Theta$) using a composite loss:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\mathcal{S}(\theta) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\theta) + \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(\theta) + \mathcal{L}_{\text{cross}}(\theta) + \mathcal{L}_{\text{dyn}}(\theta)$$
      </div>
    
      <h3>5.1 Differentiable Field-to-Graph Optimization</h3> <p>
        The central challenge in optimizing GVFT lies in backpropagating through the continuous-to-discrete instantiation process. We address this through a combination of strategies:
      </p>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4>Overcoming Non-Differentiable Operations</h4>
        <p>
          Several aspects of the instantiation process are inherently non-differentiable:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Module Sampling</strong>: Discrete sampling from the module placement probability distribution</li>
          <li><strong>Thresholding</strong>: Binary decisions about connection existence</li>
          <li><strong>Max/Min Operations</strong>: Bounding of connection weights</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We employ three complementary techniques to maintain end-to-end differentiability:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Soft Relaxations</strong>: Replacing hard thresholding with sigmoid or softmax approximations</li>
          <li><strong>Straight-Through Estimation</strong>: Using identity gradients during backpropagation</li>
          <li><strong>Controlled Stochasticity</strong>: Leveraging the reparameterization trick for sampling operations</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        The task loss evaluates the performance of the instantiated network:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-box">
        $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \ell(f_{\Theta(\theta)}(\mathbf{x}), y) \right]$$
      </div>
      <p>
        where $f_{\Theta(\theta)}$ is the neural network derived from $\Theta$, and $\ell$ is a task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy). During backpropagation, gradients flow from task performance through the instantiated architecture back to the generating fields.
      </p>
    
      <h3>5.2 Training Dynamics and Stability</h3> <p>
        Field optimization exhibits distinct training dynamics compared to standard neural networks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Two-Phase Learning</strong>: Initial rapid changes in field topology followed by refinement of existing structures</li>
        <li><strong>Field-Parameter Co-Adaptation</strong>: Fields and network parameters evolve symbiotically</li>
        <li><strong>Stabilizing Techniques</strong>: Gradient clipping, learning rate annealing, and regularization term balancing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        We employ a curriculum-based approach where training alternates between:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Architecture Phase</strong>: Updating field parameters with fixed network weights</li>
        <li><strong>Parameter Phase</strong>: Updating network weights with fixed architecture</li>
        <li><strong>Joint Phase</strong>: Simultaneous update of both aspects with adaptive weightings</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        This approach dramatically improves convergence rates and stability compared to purely joint optimization, while still discovering architectures that perform significantly better than fixed baselines.

      <p>
        For practical implementations, we employ several optimization strategies:
      </p>
      
      <h3>6.2 Scaling Strategies</h3> <ul>
         <li><strong>Hierarchical Sampling</strong>: Using adaptive mesh refinement to concentrate sampling points in regions of high field variation</li>
        <li><strong>Fourier-Domain Computation</strong>: Leveraging FFT for efficient evaluation of certain field types, reducing complexity from $\mathcal{O}(s^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(s \log s)$</li>
        <li><strong>Graph Sparsification</strong>: Enforcing a maximum connectivity degree $k \ll m$ through k-nearest neighbor pruning</li>
        <li><strong>Monte Carlo Integration</strong>: Approximating regularization integrals via importance sampling:
          <div class="equation-box">
            $$\int_{\Omega} \|\nabla \phi(\mathbf{x})\|^2 d\mathbf{x} \approx \frac{|\Omega|}{S} \sum_{s=1}^S \|\nabla \phi(\mathbf{x}_s)\|^2 \cdot q(\mathbf{x}_s)$$
          </div>
          where $q(\mathbf{x})$ is a learned importance distribution focusing on high-gradient regions</li>
        <li><strong>GPU Parallelization</strong>: Implementing field evaluations as tensor operations amenable to modern accelerators</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>6.3 Practical Scaling Limits</h3> <p>
        Our empirical analysis identifies several practical scaling constraints:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Spatial Dimensionality</strong>: Performance remains tractable for $d \leq 4$ on commodity hardware; higher dimensions require sparse field representations</li>
        <li><strong>Module Count</strong>: Full end-to-end differentiability maintained for networks with $m \leq 10^3$ modules; larger networks benefit from hierarchical decomposition</li>
        <li><strong>Field Complexity</strong>: Using functional approximations with $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ parameters per field provides sufficient expressivity while maintaining computational efficiency</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        These scaling properties position GVFT between the efficiency of fixed architectures and the flexibility of unconstrained graph neural networks, with particularly favorable characteristics for medium-scale modular systems (100-1000 modules).

      <h2>7. Fitting GVFT to and from Biological Connectomes</h2>
      <p>
        A key application of GVFT is its ability to bridge between discrete neural architecture descriptions (such as connectomes) and continuous field representations. This section describes our approach to establishing this bidirectional mapping, with a focus on extracting field representations from biological connectome data.
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.1 Extracting GVFT Fields from Biological Data</h3>
      <p>
        To address the limitations of uniform prior simulations identified in Section 4, we developed a pipeline to extract GVFT fields from structured biological neural network data. This pipeline targets NeuroML2 format files, which provide standardized representations of neural circuits including cell types, connectivity, and synaptic properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extraction pipeline follows three main stages:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Connectome Analysis:</strong> The system parses the NeuroML specification to extract neural populations, connection weights, synaptic properties (including excitatory/inhibitory classification and conduction delays), and cell type information.</li>
        <li><strong>Spatial Embedding:</strong> For networks without explicit spatial coordinates, the system performs synthetic spatial embedding based on connectivity patterns, using techniques from graph drawing and community detection to position neurons in a meaningful 2D representation.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Scale Field Generation:</strong> The system computes multiple field representations from the embedded connectome:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flow Field ($\mathbf{F}$):</strong> Generated by analyzing directional connectivity patterns between neural communities and computing their gradients.</li>
            <li><strong>Synaptic Strength Field ($W$):</strong> Created by placing Gaussian kernels at neuron positions, weighted by centrality measures and cell-type importance.</li>
            <li><strong>Neuromodulatory Field ($\eta$):</strong> Derived from simulated activity patterns and connection densities across the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Field:</strong> A supplementary representation that encodes the modular organization of the network based on community detection algorithms.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This approach has been successfully applied to C. elegans pharyngeal nervous system data, generating field representations that capture both the structural and functional characteristics of the original biological network. The extracted fields show non-uniform, structured patterns that reflect the underlying organization of the biological circuit, including functional clustering, directed information flow, and heterogeneous connectivity densities.
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.2 From Biological Priors to GVFT Simulations</h3>
      <p>
        The extracted biological field representations serve as informed priors for GVFT simulations, replacing the uniform initialization used in our preliminary work. These biologically grounded priors are expected to guide the field dynamics toward functionally relevant patterns and architectural motifs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our planned simulation studies will examine how these biologically informed priors influence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The emergence and stability of functional architectural motifs</li>
        <li>The parameter regions supporting biologically plausible dynamics</li>
        <li>The transfer of structural and functional properties from source biological networks to synthetic architectures</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Preliminary analyses suggest that the biologically extracted priors contain rich structure at multiple spatial scales, potentially supporting the emergence of hierarchical processing architectures similar to those observed in biological neural systems.
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.3 GVFT to Neural Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        The inverse process—deriving plausible neural architectures from GVFT fields—follows the procedure detailed in Section 3. Given fields $\Theta$, we generate a network with modules $V = \{M_i\}$ and edges $E = \{w_{ij}, \tau_{ij}\}$ by probabilistically sampling module positions based on field values and computing connectivity according to flow alignment and synaptic strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        This bidirectional mapping between connectomic data and field representations enables several novel applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compression:</strong> Representing complex connectomes in a compact, continuous form that captures essential structural and functional properties</li>
        <li><strong>Controlled Variation:</strong> Generating families of related architectures by applying transformations to the field representations</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Scale Transfer:</strong> Translating architectural principles across different scales and modalities through field-mediated representations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Future work will focus on quantifying the fidelity of this bidirectional mapping and developing optimization techniques to improve the reconstruction of functional properties when translating between discrete and continuous representations.

      <h3>Detailed Connections to Existing Work</h3>
      <p>
        GVFT builds upon and extends several lines of research in architecture design and biological modeling. Here we clarify these connections in detail:
      </p>
      
      <h4>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)</h4>
      <p>
        Liu et al. (2019) introduced DARTS as a gradient-based method for architecture search, relaxing the discrete search space into a continuous one. GVFT shares this differentiable philosophy but differs fundamentally in representation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DARTS</strong> uses architecture parameters α to weight operations in a fixed DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure.</li>
        <li><strong>GVFT</strong> defines continuous spatial fields from which both module placement and connection strength emerge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        DARTS optimizes a supernet to approximate performance without full training, similar to how GVFT samples architectures from field values. However, DARTS lacks the ability to model dynamic processes or encode spatial relationships that GVFT emphasizes.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)</h4>
      <p>
        Chen et al. (2018) formulated neural network layers as continuous transformations defined by ODEs. GVFT's dynamic field equations (especially for neuromodulatory fields) are conceptually related but serve a different purpose:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neural ODEs</strong> define network activations as continuous processes in time.</li>
        <li><strong>GVFT</strong> uses PDEs to model how architectural properties evolve in both space and time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While Neural ODEs focus on continuous-depth activations, GVFT applies continuous mathematics to the meta-level of architecture specification itself.
      </p>
      
      <h4>HyperNetworks and Weight Generation</h4>
      <p>
        Ha et al. (2017) introduced HyperNetworks that generate weights for another network. GVFT's field-to-architecture mapping has parallels:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HyperNetworks</strong> use a network to generate weights for a target network, creating a weight-sharing dynamic.</li>
        <li><strong>GVFT</strong> uses field ensembles to specify connectivity patterns and module properties across a spatial domain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The key difference is that hypernetworks typically generate weights directly, while GVFT generates architectural specifications from which weights are then derived through spatial interpretations.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Architecture Learning</h4>
      <p>
        Recent work by You et al. (2020) uses graph neural networks for architecture search by learning graph-level representations. GVFT's approach to modular connectivity complements this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Graph-based NAS</strong> requires discrete graph operations and struggles with continuous optimization.</li>
        <li><strong>GVFT</strong> represents architectures as continuous fields, making them amenable to gradient-based optimization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        GVFT could potentially be combined with GNN approaches, using GNNs to better process the resulting architectures once instantiated from fields.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Biologically-Inspired Neural Development</h4>
      <p>
        GVFT draws heavily from neurodevelopmental principles studied by Ooyen (2011) and others:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Biological neural development</strong> uses molecular gradients, cell migration, and axon guidance to form structured connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>GVFT</strong> abstracts these principles into differentiable fields that can be optimized for computational tasks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unlike purely abstract computational approaches, GVFT maintains biological plausibility by modeling development-inspired processes like flow fields (analogous to axon guidance) and modulatory fields (analogous to neurotransmitter systems).
